About the DragPieceDemo files....'DragPieceDemo.pas' is an 'Edit' text file containing sourcecode for our 'almost generic' DragPiece() procedure used in a simple example program.'aDragPiece.rsrc' is a resource file which is linked to the Demo code.'DragPieceDemo' is the application file.'DragPiece animation' is a paint-type file that illustrates what's happening.We're including this Demo with 'ZeroGravity' because it illustrates the sameprinciple of animation over backgrounds with some improvements, refinements,etc.  We make extensive use of this procedure in our new 'PUZZ'L' application.
