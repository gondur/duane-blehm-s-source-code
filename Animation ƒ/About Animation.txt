About the Animation Demo files:{note: TML is now shipping version 2.5 of their Pascal, believe it isfree to version 2.0 owners.  Fixes some stuff for the new System.  Wedidn't have any trouble with 2.0 until we moved up to System 4.1.  Thepackage includes 'Edit' version 2.1.  'Edit' is also available from APDA..seethe MoreInfo.sit files.**note: Watch out for the new print stuff and systems before 4.1!}'Animation Steps' is a 'FullPaint' document that illustrates the stepsin getting graphics from a Paint program to animation on the screen...document can be opened from most Paint type programs.'Animation.Pas' is an 'Edit' text file containing pascal sourcecode to be compiled by the Pascal compiler.'Anim.R' is an 'Edit' text file containing RMaker source code tobe compiled by RMaker.'Anim/Rsrc' is a resource document containing resources built withResEdit, the resource editor.  These resources are 'included' whenAnim.R is compiled by RMaker.'Animation' is our application... the result of Link.
